# cymirCNV
## A cytoscape plugin for miRNA-gene correlation network visualization

cymirCNV is a Cytoscape plug-in designed for constructing and visualizing miRNA-gene correlation networks from expression data. It supports Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis, allowing users to explore regulatory interactions with customizable thresholds. Ideal for researchers studying miRNA-mediated gene regulation, cymirCNV streamlines data preprocessing, correlation computation, and network visualization within Cytoscape.

# cymiRCNV: A Step-by-Step Tutorial
## A Cytoscape plug-in for miRNA-Gene Correlation Network Analysis

## 1. Introduction
cymiRCNV is a Cytoscape plug-in designed for constructing and visualizing miRNA-gene correlation networks from expression data. It supports Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis and allows users to explore regulatory interactions interactively.

## 2. Installation
### Method 1: Install from Cytoscape App Store
Open Cytoscape.
Go to Apps â†’ App Manager.
Search for cymiRCNV.
Click Install and wait for the installation to complete.
Restart Cytoscape to enable the plug-in.
### Method 2: Manual Installation (Alternative)
Download the cymiRCNV JAR file from the Cytoscape App Store or GitHub.
In Cytoscape, go to Apps â†’ App Manager â†’ Install from File.
Select the downloaded cymiRCNV JAR file and click Open.
Restart Cytoscape to apply changes.

## 3. Preparing Input Data  

To use **cymiRCNV**, you need **paired gene and miRNA expression data** from the **same samples**.  

#### File Format  
- The data should be in **CSV** format.  
- The **first column** should contain **miRNA or gene IDs**.  
- The **remaining columns** should contain **expression values** for each sample (recommended to use normalized count).  
- **Sample IDs must match exactly** between miRNA and gene expression datasets.  

#### Example: miRNA Expression Data

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes:
### âœ” File format: Ensure the data is correctly formatted (no missing values & normalized).
### âœ” Matching columns: The sample IDs must be identical in both miRNA and gene expression datasets.
